## Problem

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

```
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3

```

begin to intersect at node c1.

**Notes:**

- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.



## Solution

* 遍历两个链表，计算长度，使用长度差让长链表先走，等到一样长的时候，再一起走，看节点是否相等。（两个指针）
