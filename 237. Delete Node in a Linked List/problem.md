## Problem

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

```
    4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9
```

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```



## Solution

* 用下一个节点的值替换，并把next指针指向下下一个节点。
