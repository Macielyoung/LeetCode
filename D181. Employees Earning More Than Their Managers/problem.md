## Problem

The `Employee` table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

```
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```

Given the `Employee` table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

```
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```

 

## Solution

查找雇员工资比经理高的员工。

* 直接比较工资，同时员工的managerid等于经理的id。

  select Name as Employee from Employee e 
  where e.Salary > (select Salary from Employee m where m.Id = e.ManagerId)
